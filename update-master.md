🚀 How to Update Your Master Prompt Using a GitHub Pull Request (PR)

Since I can't directly commit to your repository, you will need to follow these steps to track and merge updates efficiently.
🔹 Step 1: Create a New Branch for the Update

Instead of editing your main branch directly, you'll create a separate feature branch to track changes.

    Go to your GitHub repository:
    🔗 https://github.com/johns-vanilla-php/ven-sec

    Click on the "Branch: main" dropdown at the top left.

    Type a new branch name, e.g.:

    update-master-prompt

        Click "Create branch from main" to create your new branch.

🔹 Step 2: Edit Your Master Prompt in the New Branch

    Go to your master-prompt.md file inside the update-master-prompt branch.
    Click "Edit" (pencil icon ✏️).
    Copy & Paste the updated version of the Master Prompt that I provide.
    Scroll down and write a commit message, e.g.:

    Updated Master Prompt with new feature requirements

    Click "Commit changes."

🔹 Step 3: Open a Pull Request (PR)

Now, you need to merge your updated branch into main.

    Go back to your repository homepage.
    Click the "Pull Requests" tab.
    Click "New Pull Request."
    Select:
        Base branch: main
        Compare branch: update-master-prompt
    GitHub will show the changes you made.
    Click "Create Pull Request."
    Add a PR description (e.g., "Updating Master Prompt with new project details").
    Click "Submit Pull Request."

🔹 Step 4: Merge the Pull Request

Once you've reviewed the changes:

    Click "Merge Pull Request."
    Click "Confirm Merge."
    (Optional) Delete the feature branch (update-master-prompt) to keep your repo clean.

🚀 Now your Master Prompt is updated in the main branch!
💡 Next Steps
